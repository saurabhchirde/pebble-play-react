You proceed to read up on compositional rules and you realise there’s a lot to learn. The rule of thirds, the golden spiral, the phi grid, the Fibonacci sequence, leading lines, arabesques and dynamic symmetry. It all looks very complex and confusing. \n\nYou examine bodies of work taken by a variety of well-respected photographers, but rarely find any examples that fit with these rules you’ve read about. In fact, most of these images almost read like a list of case studies showing what not to do.\n\nYou’re confused and overwhelmed and really don’t know where to start.\n\nThe problem is that composition is a massive subject and learning all the grid systems and ratios is only one tool in your visual toolbox. So let me give you 8 simple tips to get you started on improving your composition.\n\nCORRECTION: The Factory image at 7:45 is mislabelled as Edward Burtynsky.
